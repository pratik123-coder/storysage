Setting Description:
The town where Lily lived was a picturesque place with cobblestone streets, colorful houses with flower-filled gardens, and a bustling town square where people gathered to chat and buy fresh produce. The rolling hills surrounded the town like a protective embrace, with tall oak trees and bubbling brooks dotting the landscape. The sky was a never-ending canvas of blue during the day and a twinkling blanket of stars at night. It was a place where magic truly felt at home.
